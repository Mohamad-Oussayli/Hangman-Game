# Hangman-Game
Hangman game is a program that operates as the guesser, employing a specialized greedy algorithm and an extensive word dataset for optimal guessing strategies. Implemented a systematic approach inspired by human gameplay, enabling the program to analyze word patterns and select educated guesses with high precision. 

How to play?
1-Open any dataset file and choose any word you like
2-Open the main file and run it
3-Follow the instructions after you run the file
4-Note: In case you word has a letter present 2 times, make sure to put both locations of the letter otherwise the program won't guess it
Example: If your word is hello
And the program asked if 'l' is in the word
Enter y
When the program asks about the location
Enter 2 3 
leave a space between the numbers and enter both positions
Since the program only ask 1 time if a specific letter is present or not

GOOD LUCK BEATING THE GAME
